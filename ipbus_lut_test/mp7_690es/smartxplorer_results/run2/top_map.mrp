Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       14,880
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         5,321 out of  14,880   35%
    Number with an unused LUT:               4,687 out of  14,880   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       4,872 out of  14,880   32%
    Number of unique control sets:             533
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           1,818 out of 866,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
